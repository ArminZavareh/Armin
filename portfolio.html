    <h1>This is my Portfolio Page!</h1>
<h2>I was a part of Advance Theater for a year.

 <h2>The picture below the project my team and I created. The idea of this project is inspired by not polluting the oceans in order to save marine animals.</h2>

<h3>We made a very simple project but with very meaningful lesson. On the background, we chose a kind of blue that represents ocean, and we wanted others to feel relaxed.</h3>
<h3> Then we will have a fish moving from right to left, and then we will see a turtle eat a plastic waste which results in killing him.</h3>
<h3>In the end, we decided to write a text like a warning to warn people to stop throwing their wastes on oceans because we can save millions of marine animals by our actions.</h3>

<h1> The picture below is the second project that I created with my new team. Our game is an alternative version of pac-man.</h1>

<h3> As I mentioned earlier, our game was inspired by pac-man.<h3>
<h3>We tried to use the pac-man himself as the playable character, but we used a turtle instead so we can make it look interesting.<h3>
<h3>The whole point of the game is to collect all four fruits by avoiding any contacts with ghosts.<h3>

<h3>If you win the game, the screen will say "You Won". If a ghost touches you, then the screen will show "You Lost" with your name and score.
<br/>

<h2>Out third project was a survival game. A fish had to avoid hitting sharks, and score points until it hits a shark. We put a real ocean background so our game looks more authentic.<h2/>

<img src="Gameover.JPG" height="500" width="1000">
<h2>We decided to chose a white background screen when the "Game Over" sign pops out so players do not be iritated by the wuick tranformation from the ocean background to gameover screen.<h2/>

<h3> My fourth project was the first project I've created in Scratch. The game is called prison break. The picture above is the first thing that the player will see, and it can give players the option to choose either dog or man to be the controlable character.</h3>
<a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/465091313"> You can play the game by this link</a>
<img src="man2.JPG" height="500" width="1000">
<h3>The picture above shows the first level of the game(and it shows how the man character look like)</h3>
<img src="dog.JPG" height="500" width="1000">
<h3>The point of this game is to collect keys in the level so we can open the doors and go to the next level.</h3>
<img src="lastlevel1.JPG" height="500" width="1000">
<h3>The picture above is the last and hardest level of the game. The red flame represents volcano, and the policeman represents the gaurdian of the key. If the playable charavter hits one of them, the game will stop, but if palyers manage to pass the third door, then they will win.</h3>
<img src="win.JPG" height="500" width="1000">
<h3> The winning sign will look like the picture above.</h3>
