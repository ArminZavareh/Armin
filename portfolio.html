 <h2>The picture below the project my team and I created. The idea of this project is inspired by not polluting the oceans in order to save marine animals.</h2>

<h3>We made a very simple project but with very meaningful lesson. On the background, we chose a kind of blue that represents ocean, and we wanted others to feel relaxed.</h3>
<h3> Then we will have a fish moving from right to left, and then we will see a turtle eat a plastic waste which results in killing him.</h3>
<h3>In the end, we decided to write a text like a warning to warn people to stop throwing their wastes on oceans because we can save millions of marine animals by our actions.</h3>

<h1> The picture below is the second project that I created with my new team. Our game is an alternative version of pac-man.</h1>

<h3> As I mentioned earlier, our game was inspired by pac-man.<h3>
<h3>We tried to use the pac-man himself as the playable character, but we used a turtle instead so we can make it look interesting.<h3>
<h3>The whole point of the game is to collect all four fruits by avoiding any contacts with ghosts.<h3>

<h3>If you win the game, the screen will say "You Won". If a ghost touches you, then the screen will show "You Lost" with your name and score.
